<h1>ExifTool FAQ</h1>

<h4>"Is there a forum for discussing ExifTool issues?"</h4>

<blockquote>
ExifTool issues can be discussed on the CPAN forum at
<a href="http://www.cpanforum.com/dist/Image-ExifTool">http://www.cpanforum.com/dist/Image-ExifTool</a>
</blockquote>

<h4>"How do I determine the tag name for some information?"</h4>

<blockquote>
When you run exiftool, by default it prints descriptions, not tag names, for
the information it extracts.  To print the tag names instead, use the
<code><font color='#880000'>'-S'</font></code> option.  Also, see the
<a href="TagNames/index.html">tag names documentation</a> for a complete list
of available tag names.
</blockquote>

<h4>"ExifTool reports the wrong value for a tag",
<br>"ExifTool doesn't write a tag properly", or
<br>"Other software can't read information written by ExifTool"</h4>

<blockquote>
Make sure you are looking at the right information.  Information may be
duplicated in different locations within an image.  When in doubt, use
<code><font color='#880000'>'exiftool -a -G1 FILENAME'</font></code> to show all
information and the locations in the file.  In this command,
<code><font color='#880000'>'-a'</font></code> allows duplicate tags to be
displayed, <code><font color='#880000'>'-G1'</font></code> shows the family 1
group name (ie. the location) of each tag, and
<code><font color='#880000'>'FILENAME'</font></code> is the name of your image
file.  Also, you may want to add <code><font color='#880000'>'-S'</font></code>
to show the actual tag names instead of the descriptions.

<p>You can read or write information in a specific location if necessary by
prefixing the tag name on the command line with the desired group name.  ie)
<code><font color='#880000'>'-ExifIFD:DateTimeOriginal'</font></code>
</blockquote>

<h4>"ExifTool reports more than one shutter speed or aperture value, and
they are slightly different"</h4>

<blockquote>
There are a number of different ways that aperture and shutter speed information
get saved in an image.  The standard EXIF values (EXIF:FNumber and
EXIF:ExposureTime) should correspond to the values displayed by your camera, but
these values may have been rounded off.  The APEX values (EXIF:ApertureValue and
EXIF:ShutterSpeedValue) may be different due to their own round-off errors.  If
available, the MakerNotes values are the typically the most accurate because
they haven't been rounded off at all, but you may see odd values like 1/102
instead of 1/100, etc.
</blockquote>

<h4>"I can't delete all EXIF information from a TIFF file using
<code><font color='#880000'>'exiftool -exif:all= img.tif'</font></code>"</h4>

<blockquote>
This is because of the way a TIFF file is structured.  With a JPEG image, this
command will remove IFD0 (the main Image File Directory) as well as any
subdirectories, thus removing all EXIF information.  But with the TIFF format,
the main image itself is stored in IFD0, so deleting this directory would
destroy the image.  Instead, ExifTool just deletes the ExifIFD subdirectory, so
any information stored in other directories is preserved.

<p>Use <code><font color='#880000'>'exiftool -a -G1 img.tif'</font></code> to
see where the information is stored.  Any information remaining in other IFD's
must be deleted separately from a TIFF file if desired.
