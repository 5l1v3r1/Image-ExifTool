<h1>Image Format Idiosyncracies</h1>

It really is suprising how stupid some (...many, ...most?) manufacturers seem to
be when it comes to writing what should be a fairly simple file format.

<p>One positive thing is that most manufacturers seem to have adopted the use of
an EXIF-like IFD (Image File Directory) structure for their maker notes.  But
many problems arise because of a fundamental design flaw in the EXIF/TIFF
format.  Values longer than 4 bytes are stored at a location referenced by an
offset from an absolute position in the file (where offset 0 is the start of the
EXIF/TIFF information).

<p>The difficulty is that these offsets must be recalculated when a file is
rewritten, but in general this is not possible (particularly for the maker
notes) because the format of not all information is known.  Some manufacturers
have attempted to avoid this problem using offsets which are relative to the
start of the maker note IFD instead of the usual start of EXIF.  This is a good
idea if implemented properly, but this is not done consistently.  (And some
manufacturers are not even consistent about how the offsets are calculated from
one camera model to the next!)

<blockquote>Technical aside: If EXIF were designed properly, all offsets would
be relative to 4 bytes after the end of the IFD, which is the normal position
for values to be stored, and all value data for the IFD would be stored in a
block at this location.  If this was done, an entire IFD could be relocated
easily without causing problems.</blockquote>

Below is a list of idiosyncracies in files written by the digital cameras or
software from various manufacturers.  Many of these quirks relate to the offset
problem mentioned above.

<hr>

<p><b>Canon:</b> The 350D (firmware 1.0.1) gets the size of the thumbnail image
wrong and reports it to be 10 bytes too long.  This can cause the reported
thumbnail image data to run off the end of the APP1 segment.

<p><b>Casio:</b> The preview image is referenced by two different offsets (the
PreviewImage tag plus a PreviewImageStart/PreviewImageLength pair).  Also, the
offset for the PrintIM information is relative to the start of the IFD entry
even though other offsets aren't.

<p><b>Concord:</b> Some models write PrintIM information with an entry-based
offset like Casio.

<p><b>Kodak:</b> Professional DCS Photo Desk software writes a cyclical EXIF
directory such that the InteropIFD pointer points back to IFD0.

<p><b>Konica:</b> The KD-300Z writes all maker notes offsets relative to the
start of the individual IFD entry.

<p><b>Minolta:</b> An obvious bug in the firmware of the Z2 writes an incorrect
offset for the 'MinoltaCameraSettings2' information -- it writes the offset of
the offset itself instead of the offset of the value (hahaha!).  Other
offsets are correct.

<p><b>Kyocera:</b> A number of models write all maker notes offsets relative
to the start of the individual IFD entry.

<p><b>Nikon:</b> D2H NEF files have huge blocks with all zero data (3.7 MB in
my test file!).

<p><b>Olympus:</b> The E-1 and E-300 have subdirectories in the maker notes,
but not only does the data size of these subdirectories exclude the subdirectory
value data, but also it is 2 bytes too small for the directory information
itself (doh! -- they forgot to include the entry count).

<p><b>Pentax:</b> The Optio 330 uses an offset for the PrintIM information which
is relative to the start of the IFD entry (hmmm, like some Casio models...). 
Also, preview image offsets in the maker notes are given relative to the EXIF
base rather than the maker note base (like all other maker notes offsets).

<p>The Optio 550, 555, 33WR and 43WR all specify a PrintIM directory at a the
same offset of 0x29a with length 40 bytes, but the only PrintIM information in
the file is nowhere near that offset and is 128 bytes long.  Also for these
models, tag 0x002e has a constant value of 0x6a6 even though its position
changes.  Finally, all of these models plus the Optio WP waste many kilobytes of
space in each image with large unused data blocks in the EXIF information.

<p>The Optio 330RS and 430RS double reference the preview image information.

<p>Note that the worst problems are with the Optio 230, 330, and 430, which
were built for Pentax by Asahi.

<p><b>Photoshop and Nikon Capture:</b> Both of these packages write TIFF IPTC
information as 'int32u' (or 'LONG').  This is wrong
(<a href="http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/tifftags/iptc.html">see
reference</a>).  Nikon Capture goes one step further and simply ignores IPTC
that is written correctly as 'undef' or 'int8u'.  (So for compatibility,
ExifTool also writes this incorrectly as 'int32u'.)

<p><b>Ricoh:</b> An IFD subdirectory in the Ricoh maker notes of both the
Caplio RR30 and RR1.  The RR30 uses standard EXIF offsets (relative to the start
of the EXIF data), but for the RR1 the offsets are relative to the start of the
subdirectory.

<p><b>Rollei:</b> The DK4010 writes all maker notes offsets relative to the
start of the individual IFD entry.

<p><b>Skanhex:</b> With some Skanhex models (SX-210Z3, SX-330Z3, SX3300,
SX410Z3), the 264-byte makernotes block contains no useful information, and
overlaps values from the ExifIFD.  For these models there is also a large block
(typically 1195 bytes) of unreferenced information in the EXIF data immediately
following the IteropIFD.  This block begins with the character sequence
"SKANH\0", and contains exactly the same information in all 20 of my sample
images that contain this block (except for a variable amount of padding at the
end with 0xff bytes).  These quirks also affect some Gateway, Jenoptik, Medion,
Samsung and Yakumo models built by Skanhex.

<p><b>Toshiba:</b> The PDR-3310 writes all maker notes offsets relative to the
start of the individual IFD entry.  (very similar to Konica KD-300Z)
