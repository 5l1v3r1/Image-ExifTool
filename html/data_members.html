<h1>ExifTool Object Data Members</h1>

The following table lists the data members of the ExifTool object.
If this was C++, these would be documented next to the definitions in the
header file.  (but this is Perl, so I couldn't do that...)

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>ADD_DIRS</td><td>Hash of parent directories for each directory added during
	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
	directory!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>CHANGED</td><td>Number of tags changed during writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraMake</td><td>Camera make set during reading and writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraModel</td><td>Camera model name set during reading and writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>DEL_GROUP</td><td>Hash of groups to delete</td></tr>

<tr><td>DEL_PREVIEW</td><td>Flag to delete preview from after JPEG EOI</td></tr>

<tr><td>DIR_NAME</td><td>Name of directory currently being processed</td></tr>

<tr><td>EDIT_DIRS</td><td>Hash of parent directories for each directory edited during
	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
	directory!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_BYTE_ORDER</td><td>Byte ordering for main EXIF directory</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_DATA</td><td>Reference to EXIF data while reading file</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_POS</td><td>Position of EXIF data in file</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILENAME</td><td>Name of input file while extracting (only if we opened it, '' otherwise)</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILE_ORDER</td><td>Hash of numbers to give the sequence the tags were
    extracted from file, keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILE_TYPE</td><td>File type (JPEG, TIFF, etc...)</td></tr>

<tr><td>FOUND_TAGS</td><td>Found tags with proper case and order</td></tr>

<tr><td>INDENT</td><td>Indent string for verbose output</td></tr>

<tr><td>IO_TAG_LIST</td><td>List for output of requested tags in proper case and order</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_BYTE_ORDER</td><td>Byte order of extracted maker notes if extracted
    as a block with MakerNotes option set.</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_INFO</td><td>Used by Image::ExifTool::CanonRaw as temporary storage for
    maker note information when synthesizing maker notes from CRW file with the
    MakerNotes option.</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_FIXUP</td><td>Fixup information for maker notes extracted with the MakerNotes
    option.  Used by SetNewValuesFromFile() to adjust offsets in maker note IFD</td></tr>

<tr><td>NEW_VALUE</td><td>Hash of new value information keyed by tag info reference.
	Elements of new value information hash are:
    <table><tr><td>TagInfo</td><td>-</td><td>tag information reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DelValue</td><td>-</td><td>list of specific values to delete</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Value</td><td>-</td><td>list of values to add</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>IsCreating</td><td>-</td><td>must be set for the tag to be added.  otherwise just
    	changed if it already exists</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>Next</td><td>-</td><td>reference to next new value hash in linked list
        if there is more than one new value hash (for writing to different groups) for this
        tagInfo</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>Save</td><td>-</td><td>flag set by call to SaveNewValues() if this value
        should be saved</td></tr>
    </table></td></tr>

<tr><td>NUM_FOUND</td><td>Number of tags found</td></tr>

<tr><td>OPTIONS</td><td>ExifTool options</td></tr>

<tr><td>PREVIEW_INFO</td><td>Information about preview image used while writing JPEG
    images only.  This is a reference to a hash with the following entries:
    <table>
    <tr><td>BaseShift</td><td>-</td><td>shift for base of pointer offsets</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>Data</td><td>-</td><td>data for PreviewImage to be written (may either be data
    for the old or new image, or 'LOAD' to indicate that the data must be loaded from outside
    the EXIF segment)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fixup</td><td>-</td><td>fixup for PreviewImage pointers when writing JPEG images</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>IsValue</td><td>-</td><td>flag indicates that image was referenced as the value
    of an IFD pointer, which means the image must fit inside the EXIF segment</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Relative</td><td>-</td><td>flag to indicate that pointer offsets are relative</td></tr>
    </table></td></tr>

<tr><td>PRINT_CONV</td><td>Hash of PrintConv values keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>PRIORITY</td><td>Hash of tag Priority values for current tag, keyed by tag name (not tag key!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>PRIORITY_DIR</td><td>Name of priority IFD (ie. the IFD for the full resolution image)</td></tr>

<tr><td>RAF</td><td>Random access file object for reading from input file</td></tr>

<tr><td>REQUESTED_TAGS</td><td>List of requested tags in original case</td></tr>

<tr><td>REQ_TAG_LOOKUP</td><td>Hash for looking up requested tags (keys are lower case tag names)</td></tr>

<tr><td>SAVE_NEW_VALUE</td><td>Hash of new value information which was overwritten after
    a call to SaveNewValues()</td></tr>

<tr><td>TAG_EXTRA</td><td>Hash of extra information (IFD name or XMP namespace) keyed by
	tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>TAG_INFO</td><td>Hash of tagInfo hash references, keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>TIFF_TYPE</td><td>Type of TIFF data, only set if FILE_TYPE is TIFF.  Valid values
    are APP1, APP3, TIFF, CR2, MRW, JP2, JPX, NEF, PEF, ORF or DNG.</td></tr>

<tr><td>VALUE_CONV</td><td>Hash of ValueConv values keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>WRITE_GROUPS</td><td>List of write groups in order of priority</td></tr>

<tr><td>WRITE_PRIORITY</td><td>Hash of write priority values keyed by group name</td></tr>

<tr><td>XMP_CAPTURE</td><td>Hash of tag information (value, attribute hash) keyed by XMP
	property path, used by XMP module during writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>XMP_ERROR</td><td>Error string used by XMP module during writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>XMP_NS</td><td>Hash of URI's keyed by namespace prefix, used by XMP module
	during writing to remember all used namespaces</td></tr>
