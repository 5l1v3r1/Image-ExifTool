ExifTool Version History

Note: The most recent production release is Version 4.73.

Mar. 1/05 - Version 4.73 (production release)

  - Minor changes to XMP parsing to increase speed and improve validation

Feb. 28/05 - Version 4.72

  - Extract info from UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoded XMP
  - Convert EXIF text fields if encoded in Unicode
  - Fixed a few incorrect XP character translation codes
  - Fixed name of Nikon ColorBalanceD2H tag

Feb. 25/05 - Version 4.71

  - Fixed bug introduced in 4.70 which caused error when transferring
    information using -AllTagsFromFile from a RAW file to a JPEG file

Feb. 24/05 - Version 4.70

  - Allow family 1 group name to be specified for any tag while writing
  - Fix problem with writing Nikon PreviewImage to NEF files

Feb. 23/05 - Version 4.67

  - Add -L option to allow XP characters to be converted to Latin character set
    instead of UTF8.  (Now XP characters can be displayed properly in terminal
    windows which use either the UTF8 or WinLatin1 character set.)
  - Make JpgFromRaw image writable in Nikon NEF files

Feb. 21/05 - Version 4.66

  - Recognize JPEG 2000 XMP UUID information
  - Extract Meta information from JPEG APP3
  - Yet more playing with XP characters (this has been a learning process for
    me). Now special characters show up properly in my OSX terminal window, and
    the reverse translation works so now they get written properly as well (for
    Perl 5.6.1 or greater anyway... Earlier versions don't have the required
    UTF8 support to handle these special characters)
  - Improvements to TagNames documentation (including changing format names to
    make them more consistent across different types of meta information)

Feb. 18/05 - Version 4.65

  - Fixed problem in translating XP characters

Feb. 17/05 - Version 4.64 (production release)

  - Added new tag name documentation (replaces old tag lists)
  - Made a few more DNG tags writable

Feb. 15/05 - Version 4.63

  - Added print conversion for EXIF:CFAPattern

Feb. 14/05 - Version 4.62

  - Convert XPTitle, XPComment, XPKeywords etc from XP character codes and add
    write support for these tags
  - Decode JPEG 2000 Resolution, Label and URL information
  - Another try at patching 3 digit exponent situation which causes failed tests
    on MSWin32-x86
  - Removed .J2K from recognized extensions (since apparently this is a raw JP2
    codestream, and doesn't contain any metadata that ExifTool can extract)

Feb. 14/05 - Version 4.61

  - Don't print filename line when -p option used
  - JPEG 2000 improvements
  - Also recognize .JPX and .J2K extensions

Feb. 11/05 - Version 4.60

Feb. 10/05 - Version 4.54

  - Added ColorTemperature tag for many Canon models
  - Added AutoRotate for Canon 10D and 300D
  - Lowered priority of Nikon ISO so that EXIF ISO is used instead if both exist
  - Changed names of PentaxISO and Casio ISOSetting to ISO, and lowered priority
    as with Nikon ISO

  - Added missing inverse conversion routines for GPS tags (now they are all
    writable)
  - Decoded a few more Canon and CanonRaw tags
  - Added -z option to extract information from images in compressed files
  - Improved CanonRaw verbose output
  - Remove garbage after null terminator in CanonRaw string-type tags

Jan. 30/05 - Version 4.45

  - Added a few more Canon tags
  - Fixed bug with divide by zero error (in Perl, '0.0' is a true value -- doh!)

Jan. 30/05 - Version 4.44

  - Sort entries in synthesized Canon MakerNotes directory
  - Interpret Canon custom functions for models other than 10D in CRW files

Jan. 26/05 - Version 4.40

  - Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't
    allowed to add or delete any new tags (just as with the MakerNotes), except
    for JpgFromRaw, which I like to be able to delete to save disk space.
  - Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
  - Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed.
  - Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
  - Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)
  - API Changes:
      - Added 'Compact' option to not write blank padding as per XMP and IPTC
        specs.

    produces much prettier fractions)
  - Other minor improvements to writer code

Jan. 19/05 - Version 4.33

  - Added check at higher level and return warning if trying to delete
    information from maker notes
  - Make GPS latitude and longitude a bit more flexible about the format they
    accept when writing
  - Updates to documentation

Jan. 19/05 - Version 4.32

  - Now rewrites Casio EX-Z3 maker notes properly (well, not actually
    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
  - Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
  - Fix parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
  - No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character
  - Changed all DataDump tags to binary data types
  - Changed some warning messages

    since version 4.10)
  - Added some more writer tests

Jan. 18/05 - Version 4.31

  - Now also copies over preview image in Nikon NEF files

Jan. 18/05 - Version 4.30

    not copied).
  - Account for funny offsets in Casio EX-Z3 maker notes while extracting data
    (but haven't figured out how to handle them when writing)
  - Fix but introduced in 4.20 that broke extraction of Canon PreviewImage

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.23

  - Improve handling of unrecognized maker notes when writing

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.22

  - Added check in -AllTagsFromFile to test for pointers in the maker notes
    directory running outside the maker notes data. If they do, a warning is
    issued and the maker notes are rebuilt properly before copying.
  - Fixed problem which could corrupt some values when editing maker notes.

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.21

  - Added Olympus Red/BlueBalance

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.20

  - Added ability to edit MakerNotes!
  - Added more validation when writing IPTC information
  - Fixed display of Nikon FlashExposureComp for negative values
  - Fixed problem where the large JPEG image in Nikon and Pentax raw files was
    misidentified as the ThumbnailImage.  It is now extracted as JpgFromRaw.
    This allows all 3 JPEG images contained in Pentax PEF files to be extracted:
    ThumbnailImage, PreviewImage and JpgFromRaw.
  - Fixed problem on systems that use backslashes in directory names that
    prevented exiftool from finding its libraries if not installed
  - Changed many Pentax tag names to remove "Pentax" prefix and conform more to
    the other tag names (moving information between files of different formats
    is much easier if tags have standardized names):

      - PentaxFocusMode => FocusMode
      - PentaxWhiteBalance => WhiteBalance
      - PentaxAEMetering => MeteringMode
      - PentaxFocalLength => FocalLength

    (thanks to Christian Koller)
  - Improved write logic for EXIF information
  - Improved logic in determining byte ordering of maker notes

Jan. 10/05 - Version 4.14
