<h1>ExifTool Object Data Members</h1>

The following table lists the data members of the ExifTool object.
If this was C++, these would be documented next to the definitions in the
header file.  (but this is Perl, so I couldn't do that...)

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
	directory!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraModel</td><td>camera model name set during reading</td></tr>

    outside of maker notes data</td></tr>

<tr><td>NEW_VALUE</td><td>hash of new value information keyed by tag info reference
	Elements of new value information hash are:
