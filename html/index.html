<p>ExifTool versions 4.00 through 4.95 were an evolution of the writing
abilities, but with the release of version 5 all of the major planned
writing features have now been incorporated!

Download        Version 5.18</a> - May 16, 2005
(<a href="history.html">Version History</a>)</h3>

<p>ExifTool is a <a href="ExifTool.html">Perl module</a> with an included 
<a href="exiftool_pod.html">command-line application</a> for reading and
writing meta information in image files.  It reads EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP,
GeoTIFF, ICC Profile and Photoshop IRB meta information from JPG, JP2, TIFF,
GIF, CRW, THM, CR2, MRW, NEF, PEF, ORF and DNG images.  ExifTool also extracts
information from the maker notes of many digital cameras by various
manufacturers including Canon, Casio, FujiFilm, Kodak, Minolta/Konica-Minolta,
Nikon, Olympus/Epson, Panasonic/Leica, Pentax/Asahi, Ricoh, Sanyo and
Sigma/Foveon.

<p>ExifTool writes EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP and MakerNotes meta information to
JPEG, TIFF, GIF, CRW, THM, CR2, NEF, PEF and DNG images.  When writing,
ExifTool preserves the original file by adding "_original" to the file name.
You should keep a copy of the original, or thoroughly validate the new file
before erasing the original.  <a href="writing.html">Read here</a> for some
ramblings on the subject of writing meta information.

<p>Drop me a note if you find ExifTool useful, or if you have any comments
or suggestions.  My e-mail address is in the README file.  Thanks.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>powerful, fast, and easy to use
<li>reads EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, MakerNotes, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile and Photoshop IRB records
<li>writes EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP and MakerNotes information
<li>reads and writes maker notes of many digital cameras
<li>deletes meta information individually, in groups, or all together
<li>copies meta information between files (even if they are different formats)
<li>allows information to be rewritten to any specified tag or location
<li>highly customizable, can extract exactly what you want
<li>scans entire directory trees
<li>easy to add support for new camera types by editing ExifTool modules
<li>option to create text output file for each image file
<li>extracts thumbnail images, preview images, and JPEG images embedded in RAW files
<li>ability to organize output into groups
<li>recognizes over <a href="TagNames/index.html">1000 different tags</a>
<li>sets the file modification date from EXIF information
</ul>

<h2><font color='#cc0000'>Writer Limitations</font></h2>
<ul>
<li>ExifTool will not rewrite a file if it detects a problem with the file format.
<li>ExifTool has been tested with a wide range of different images, but since it
is not possible to test it with every known image type, there is the possibility
that it will corrupt some files.  Be sure to keep backups of your files.
<li>Even though ExifTool does some validation of the information written, it is
still possible to write illegal values which may cause problems when reading the
images with other software.  So take care to verify the information you are
writing.
</ul>

<h2>Running exiftool</h2>

The <a href="exiftool_pod.html">exiftool application</a> provides a convenient
command-line interface for the <a href="ExifTool.html">Image::ExifTool</a> Perl
module (both included in the distribution package). Once you have downloaded and
extracted the ExifTool package, you can immediately run exiftool (even before it
is built and installed) by typing "DIR/exiftool FILE", where DIR is the
directory where exiftool was extracted, and FILE is the name of an image file.

<p>Many command-line options are available to give control over the output
formatting and to allow reading or writing of specific information.  Run
exiftool with no arguments for a <a href="exiftool_pod.html">description of
exiftool, complete list of available options, and examples</a>.

<p><b>Windows users:</b> You will need to install a Perl interpreter to run
ExifTool (a good, free Perl interpreter for Windows can be obtained from
<a href="http://www.activeperl.com/Products/ActivePerl/">activeperl.com</a>).
<b>Everyone else:</b> Don't worry, you already have everything you need.

<h3>Verbose Output</h3>

The <a href="verbose.html">verbose option</a> (-v) prints additional information
that is useful for debugging or when decoding new tags.

<h2><a href="TagNames/index.html">ExifTool Tag Names</a></h2>

Tag names are entered on the command line with a leading '-' in the order you
want them displayed.  Case is not significant.  The tag name may be prefixed by
a group name from family 0 or 1, separated by a colon, to specify a location for
the information.  A special tag name of 'All' may be used to represent all tags,
or all tags in a specified group.

<blockquote>ie) "exiftool -filename -imagesize -exif:fnumber -xmp:all image.jpg"</blockquote>

<p>A complete list of <a href="TagNames/index.html">ExifTool Tag Names</a>
accompanies this documentation.  As well, current lists of available tag names
and writable tag names may be obtained using the exiftool -list and -listw
options.  But perhaps the easiest way to determine a tag name is to use the -S
option to print the tag names instead of descriptions for all information in a
file.  It may also be helpful to use the -G option to display the group names,
and the -H or -D option to print the numerical tag ID's for reference.

<p><b>Notes:</b>

<ol><li>Tag names sometimes differ from their descriptions.  Use the '-S'
command-line option to see the actual tag names instead of the descriptions
when extracting information.
<li>Values are only displayed for tags that exist in the specified file when
extracting information (unless the -f option is used).
</ol>

<h3>Shortcut Tags</h3>
Shortcuts tags represent one or more other tags, and are used like any other
tag when extracting information.

<p>ExifTool defines a few shortcut tags in the Image::ExifTool::Shortcuts
module, and allows users to define their own shortcuts by adding a
definition to the .ExifTool_config file in their home directory.  Here is a
simple example that defines two shortcuts:

<blockquote><table cellpadding=4 bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td><pre>
%Image::ExifTool::Shortcuts::UserDefined = (
    MyShortcut =&gt; ['createdate','exposuretime','aperture'],
    MyAlias =&gt; 'FocalLengthIn35mmFormat',
);
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

In this example, MyShortcut is a shortcut for the CreateDate, ExposureTime
and Aperture tags, and MyAlias is a shortcut for FocalLengthIn35mmFormat.

<p>The current shortcuts may be listed with the -list option.

<h2>Groups</h2>

ExifTool classifies tags into groups in three different families. 
These groups are:

<blockquote><table cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><th>Family</th><th>Group Names</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>0 (General Location)</b></td>
<td>Composite, EXIF, ExifTool, File, GPS, GeoTiff, ICC_Profile,
IPTC, MakerNotes, Photoshop, PrintIM, XMP</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>1&nbsp;(Detailed&nbsp;Location)</b></td>
<td>Canon, CanonCustom, CanonRaw, Casio, Composite, ExifIFD, ExifTool, File,
FujiFilm, GPS, GeoTiff, GlobParamIFD, ICC-chrm, ICC-clrt, ICC-header,
ICC-meas, ICC-view, ICC_Profile, IFD0, IFD1, IPTC, InteropIFD, Jpeg2000,
Kodak, KodakBordersIFD, KodakEffectsIFD, MakerUnknown, Minolta, Nikon,
NikonPreview, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax, Photoshop, PrintIM, Ricoh, Sanyo,
Sigma, Sony, SubIFD, XMP, XMP-aux, XMP-crs, XMP-dc, XMP-exif, XMP-iptcCore,
XMP-pdf, XMP-photoshop, XMP-tiff, XMP-xmp, XMP-xmpBJ, XMP-xmpMM, XMP-xmpRights
</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>2&nbsp;(Category)</b></td>
<td>Author, Camera, ExifTool, Image, Location, Other, Printing, Time, Unknown
</td></tr>
</table></blockquote>

The exiftool output can be organized based on these groups using the -g or
-G option.

<h2>Writing Meta Information</h2>

<p>ExifTool writes five different types of meta information:

<blockquote>
<b>1)</b> EXIF &nbsp; <b>2)</b> GPS  &nbsp; <b>3)</b> IPTC  &nbsp;
<b>4)</b> XMP  &nbsp; <b>5)</b> MakerNotes
</blockquote>

Many tag names are valid for more than one of these groups.  If a specific group
is not given then new information is added only to the highest priority group
for which the tag name is valid (but the information is changed in all groups
where the tag already existed).  The priority of the groups is given by the list
above.  Information is added preferentially to the EXIF or GPS group (there are
no common tag names between these two groups).  If the tag isn't valid in either
of these two groups, the information is added to the IPTC group, or finally the
XMP group.  The Makernotes group is special, see the note below.

<p>Alternatively, information may be written to a specific group only, bypassing
these priorities, by providing a group name for the tag.  The section below
gives the syntax rules for exiftool command-line arguments to do this.  Any
family 0 or 1 group name may be used when writing information, although not all
groups are writable.

<p><b>Note:</b> Information in the MakerNotes may be edited, but not added or
deleted.  The reason for this is to avoid confusing manufacturer-specific
software which may be very inflexible about the information it expects in the
maker notes.  The exception is the JpgFromRaw image, which may be added or
deleted from Canon CRW files.  This has been tested and doesn't cause problems
for me with the Canon software or Photoshop, however it does confuse Capture One
somewhat if this image is missing, so beware.

<h3>Argument Syntax for Writing Information</h3>

<p>Tag values are writen rather than being extracted if the tag name ends with a '='
symbol.  The '=' may be prefixed by '+', '-' or '&lt;' to add a value, remove a value
or set a value from file.  The following table outlines the different write syntaxes:

<blockquote><table cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr><th>Syntax</th><th>Result</th></tr>
<tr><td>-TAG=</td><td>Deletes all occurrances of TAG</td></tr>
<tr><td>-all=</td><td>Deletes all meta information!</td></tr>
<tr><td>-GROUP:TAG=</td><td>Deletes TAG only in specified group</td></tr>
<tr><td>-GROUP:all=</td><td>Deletes all information in specified group</td></tr>
<tr><td>-[GROUP:]TAG=VALUE</td><td>Sets value of TAG (only in GROUP if specified)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-[GROUP:]TAG+=VALUE</td><td>Adds value to a tag list (only valid for List type tags)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-[GROUP:]TAG-=VALUE</td><td>Deletes TAG only if it has the specified value</td></tr>
<tr><td>-[GROUP:]TAG&lt;=FILE</td><td>Sets tag value from contents of specified file</td></tr>
</table></blockquote>

<p>Note that quotes are required around VALUE if it contains spaces, and around the
whole argument if the '&lt;=' syntax is used (to prevent shell redirection).

<h3>The "-TagsFromFile" Option</h3>

A special ExifTool option allows copying tags from one file to another. The
command-line syntax for doing this is "-TagsFromFile SRCFILE".  Any tags
specifed after this option on the command line are extracted from source file
and written to the destination file.  If no tags are specified, then all writable
tags are copied.  This option is very simple, yet very powerful.  Depending on
the formats of the source and destination files, some of tags read may not be
valid in the destination file, in which case they aren't written.  No
translation between similar tags with different names is done, although
information may be transferred between same-named tags in different groups.

<h2>The Image::ExifTool Perl Library Module</h2>

The 'exiftool' script is essentially just a command-line interface to the
Image::ExifTool Perl library module which is part of the ExifTool distribution.
The Image::ExifTool module can be used in any Perl script to provide easy access
to meta information in images.  Here is an example a very simple script that uses
Image::ExifTool to print out all recognized meta information in a file:

<blockquote><table cellpadding=4 bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td><pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use Image::ExifTool 'ImageInfo';
my $file = shift or die "Please specify filename";
my $info = ImageInfo($file);
foreach (keys %$info) {
    print "$_ : $info-&gt;{$_}\n";
}
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>

Note that some tag values may be returned as SCALAR references indicating
binary data.  The simple script above does not handle this case.

<p>See the <a href="ExifTool.html">Image::ExifTool Documentation</a> for more details.

<h2>Boldly Go where No Man has Gone Before...</h2>

There is still much unknown information in the maker notes for many camera
models.  (To see this information, run exiftool with the -U option.)  If you
manage to figure out what any of it means, send me an e-mail and I'll update
ExifTool to decode this information.  Many thanks to all who have helped so far.
