<h1>ExifTool Object Data Members</h1>

The following table lists the data members of the ExifTool object.
If this was C++, these would be documented next to the definitions in the
header file.  (but this is Perl, so I couldn't do that...)

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>ADD_DIRS</td><td>Hash of parent directories for each directory added during
	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
	directory!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraMake</td><td>Camera make set during reading and writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraModel</td><td>Camera model name set during reading and writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraType</td><td>Camera type used for decoding some Olympus tags</td></tr>

<tr><td>CHANGED</td><td>Number of tags changed during writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>DEL_GROUP</td><td>Hash of groups to delete.  Value is 1 to delete group
    completely, or 2 if tags were added back after deleting the group.</td></tr>

<tr><td>DEL_PREVIEW</td><td>Flag to delete preview from after JPEG EOI</td></tr>

<tr><td>DIR_COUNT</td><td>Hash reference for counters of various types of directorys (ICC, IPTC,...)</td></tr>

<tr><td>DIR_NAME</td><td>Name of directory currently being processed</td></tr>

<tr><td>DONE_ID3</td><td>Set to 1 if audio file was scanned for ID3,
    or 2 if there was an ID3v1 trailer found</td></tr>

<tr><td>DROP_TAGS</td><td>Flag to exclude "Drop" tags when writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>EDIT_DIRS</td><td>Hash of parent directories for each directory edited during
	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
	directory!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_BYTE_ORDER</td><td>Byte ordering for main EXIF directory</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_DATA</td><td>EXIF data block (valid while reading from file)</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_POS</td><td>Position of EXIF data in file</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILENAME</td><td>Name of input file while extracting (only if we opened it, '' otherwise)</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILE_ORDER</td><td>Hash of numbers to give the sequence the tags were
    extracted from file, keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILE_EXT</td><td>File extension (JPG, PEF, etc...)</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILE_TYPE</td><td>File type (JPEG, TIFF, etc...)</td></tr>

<tr><td>FIRST_EXIF_POS</td><td>Position of first EXIF in file</td></tr>

<tr><td>FOUND_TAGS</td><td>Found tags with proper case and order</td></tr>

<tr><td>GROUP1</td><td>Hash of family 1 group names (ie. IFD name or XMP namespace),
    keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>INDENT</td><td>Indent string for verbose output</td></tr>

<tr><td>IO_TAG_LIST</td><td>List for output of requested tags in proper case and order</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_BYTE_ORDER</td><td>Byte order of extracted maker notes if extracted
    as a block with MakerNotes option set.</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_INFO</td><td>Used by Image::ExifTool::CanonRaw as temporary storage for
    maker note information when synthesizing maker notes from CRW file with the
    MakerNotes option.</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_FIXUP</td><td>Fixup information for maker notes extracted with the MakerNotes
    option.  Used by SetNewValuesFromFile() to adjust offsets in maker note IFD</td></tr>

<tr><td>MOVED_KEY</td><td>Tag key of last tag replaced by a higher priority tag
    in a call to FoundTag().</td></tr>

<tr><td>NEW_VALUE</td><td>Hash of new value information keyed by tag info reference.
	Elements of new value information hash are:
    <table><tr><td>TagInfo</td><td>-</td><td>tag information reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DelValue</td><td>-</td><td>list of specific values to delete</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Value</td><td>-</td><td>list of values to add</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>IsCreating</td><td>-</td><td>must be set for the tag to be added.  otherwise just
    	changed if it already exists</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>Next</td><td>-</td><td>reference to next new value hash in linked list
        if there is more than one new value hash (for writing to different groups) for this
        tagInfo</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>Save</td><td>-</td><td>flag set by call to SaveNewValues() if this value
        should be saved</td></tr>
    </table></td></tr>

<tr><td>NO_LIST</td><td>Set if List tags shouldn't be accumulated into a list</td></tr>

<tr><td>NUM_FOUND</td><td>Number of tags found</td></tr>

<tr><td>OPTIONS</td><td>ExifTool options</td></tr>

<tr><td>PREVIEW_INFO</td><td>Information about preview image used while writing JPEG
    images only.  This is a reference to a hash with the following entries:
    <table>
    <tr><td>BaseShift</td><td>-</td><td>shift for base of pointer offsets</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>Data</td><td>-</td><td>data for PreviewImage to be written (may either be data
    for the old or new image, or 'LOAD' to indicate that the data must be loaded from outside
    the EXIF segment)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fixup</td><td>-</td><td>fixup for PreviewImage pointers when writing JPEG images</td></tr>
    <tr valign='top'><td>IsValue</td><td>-</td><td>flag indicates that image was referenced as the value
    of an IFD pointer, which means the image must fit inside the EXIF segment</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Relative</td><td>-</td><td>flag to indicate that pointer offsets are relative</td></tr>
    </table></td></tr>

<tr><td>PRIORITY</td><td>Hash of tag Priority values for current tag, keyed by tag name (not tag key!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>PRIORITY_DIR</td><td>Name of priority IFD (ie. the IFD for the full resolution image)</td></tr>

<tr><td>RAF</td><td>Random access file object for reading from input file</td></tr>

<tr><td>REQUESTED_TAGS</td><td>List of requested tags in original case</td></tr>

<tr><td>REQ_TAG_LOOKUP</td><td>Hash for looking up requested tags (keys are lower case tag names)</td></tr>

<tr><td>SAVE_NEW_VALUE</td><td>Hash of new value information which was overwritten after
    a call to SaveNewValues()</td></tr>

<tr><td>SET_GROUP1</td><td>Value to use for family 1 group name when new tags
    are found.  May start with a '+' sign to add to existing group name</td></tr>

<tr><td>TAG_INFO</td><td>Hash of tagInfo hash references, keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>TIFF_END</td><td>Location of end of regular TIFF file set by WriteExif()</td></tr>
