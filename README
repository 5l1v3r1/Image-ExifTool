ExifTool by Phil Harvey (phil at owl.phy.queensu.ca)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ExifTool is a highly customizable Perl script for reading and writing meta
information in images.

ExifTool reads EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile and Photoshop IRB
meta information from JPG, JP2, TIFF, PNG, GIF, MIFF, CRW, THM, CR2, MRW,
NEF, PEF, ORF and DNG images.  ExifTool also extracts information from the
maker notes of many digital cameras by various manufacturers including
Canon, Casio, FujiFilm, Kodak, Minolta/Konica-Minolta, Nikon, Olympus/Epson,
Panasonic/Leica, Pentax/Asahi, Ricoh, Sanyo and Sigma/Foveon.

ExifTool writes EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP and MakerNotes meta information to
JPEG, TIFF, GIF, CRW, THM, CR2, NEF, PEF and DNG images.

See html/index.html for more details about ExifTool features.

server is not permanent.

RUNNING

The exiftool script can be run right away without the need to install
Image::ExifTool.  For example, from within the exiftool directory you can
extract the information from one of the included test files by typing:

   ./exiftool t/ExifTool.jpg

If you move the exiftool script to a different directory, you must also
either move the contents of the lib directory or install the Image::ExifTool
package so the script can find the necessary libraries.

Note:  On some systems you may need to rename 'exiftool' to 'exiftool.pl' to
run it directly from the command line.  Alternatively, you can run exiftool
with the command 'perl exiftool'.

IF YOU ARE STILL CONFUSED

The exiftool script is a command line application.  You run it by typing
commands in a terminal window.  The first step is to determine the name of
the directory where you downloaded the ExifTool distribution package.  For
the sake of argument, I'll assume it was in a folder called "Desktop" in
your home directory.  To extract and run exiftool from this directory, you
type the following in a terminal window:

   cd ~/Desktop
   tar -xzf Image-ExifTool-#.##.tar.gz
   cd Image-ExifTool-#.##
   ./exiftool t/ExifTool.jpg

Note: You must replace "#.##" in the commands above with the actual version
number of ExifTool that you downloaded.  These commands extract meta
information from one of the test images.  To use one of your images instead,
enter the full path name of your file in place of "t/ExifTool.jpg".

INSTALLATION

You can install the Image::ExifTool package to make it available for use by
other Perl scripts by typing the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Notes:
   i) You need root access for the last step above.
   ii) Some Perl installations (like the standard OSX installation) may not
   contain the necessary files to complete the first step above.  But no
   worries:  You can install ExifTool manually by moving 'exiftool' and the
   'lib' directory to any directory in your current PATH.

DEPENDENCIES

Requires Perl version 5.004 or later.  No other special libraries are
required, however Compress::Zlib is used if available to decode PNG
compressed information.
