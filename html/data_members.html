<h1>ExifTool Object Data Members</h1>

The following table lists the data members of the ExifTool object.
If this was C++, these would be documented next to the definitions in the
header file.  (but this is Perl, so I couldn't do that...)

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>ADD_DIRS</td><td>Hash of parent directories for each directory added during
	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
	directory!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>CHANGED</td><td>Number of tags changed during writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraMake</td><td>Camera make set during reading and writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>CameraModel</td><td>Camera model name set during reading and writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>DIR_NAME</td><td>Name of directory currently being processed</td></tr>

<tr><td>EDIT_DIRS</td><td>Hash of parent directories for each directory edited during
	writing (Note: entry may exist but be undefined for top-level
	directory!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_BYTE_ORDER</td><td>Byte ordering for main EXIF directory</td></tr>

<tr><td>EXIF_DATA</td><td>Reference to EXIF data while reading file</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILENAME</td><td>Name of input file while extracting (only if we opened it, '' otherwise)</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILE_ORDER</td><td>Hash of numbers to give the sequence the tags were
    extracted from file, keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>FILE_TYPE</td><td>File type (JPEG, TIFF, etc...)</td></tr>

<tr><td>FOUND_TAGS</td><td>Found tags with proper case and order</td></tr>

<tr><td>INDENT</td><td>Indent string for verbose output</td></tr>

<tr><td>IO_TAG_LIST</td><td>List for output of requested tags in proper case and order</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_ENTRIES</td><td>Used by Image::ExifTool::CanonRaw as temporary storage for
    maker note directory entries when synthesizing maker notes from CRW file with the
    MakerNotes option</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_POS</td><td>Position of maker note in source file set if maker notes are
    extracted with MakerNotes option.  Used by SetNewValuesFromFile() to adjust offsets in
    maker note IFD</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_VAL_BUFF</td><td>Used by Image::ExifTool::CanonRaw as temporary storage for
    maker note value information when synthesizing maker notes from CRW file with the
    MakerNotes option</td></tr>

<tr><td>MAKER_NOTE_WARN</td><td>Warning flag set if pointers in maker notes directory run
    outside of maker notes data</td></tr>

<tr><td>NEW_VALUE</td><td>Hash of new value information keyed by tag info reference
	Elements of new value information hash are:
    <table><tr><td>TagInfo</td><td>- tag information reference</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DelValue</td><td>- list of specific values to delete</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Value</td><td>- list of values to add</td></tr>
    <tr><td>IsCreating</td><td>- must be set for the tag to be added.  otherwise just
    	changed if it already exists</td></tr></table>

<tr><td>NUM_FOUND</td><td>Number of tags found</td></tr>

<tr><td>OPTIONS</td><td>ExifTool options</td></tr>

<tr><td>PRINT_CONV</td><td>Hash of PrintConv values keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>PRIORITY</td><td>Hash of tag Priority values for current tag, keyed by tag name (not tag key!)</td></tr>

<tr><td>RAF</td><td>Random access file object for reading from input file</td></tr>

<tr><td>REQUESTED_TAGS</td><td>List of requested tags in original case</td></tr>

<tr><td>TAG_EXTRA</td><td>Hash of extra information (IFD name or XMP namespace) keyed by
	tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>TAG_INFO</td><td>Hash of tagInfo hash references, keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>TIFF_TYPE</td><td>Type of TIFF data, only set if FILE_TYPE is TIFF.  Valid values
    are APP1, APP3, TIFF, CR2, MRW, JP2, JPX, NEF, PEF, ORF or DNG.</td></tr>

<tr><td>VALUE_CONV</td><td>Hash of ValueConv values keyed by tag key</td></tr>

<tr><td>WRITE_GROUPS</td><td>List of write groups in order of priority</td></tr>

<tr><td>WRITE_PRIORITY</td><td>Hash of write priority values keyed by group name</td></tr>

<tr><td>XMP_CAPTURE</td><td>Hash of tag information (value, attribute hash) keyed by XMP
	property path, used by XMP module during writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>XMP_ERROR</td><td>Error string used by XMP module during writing</td></tr>

<tr><td>XMP_NS</td><td>Hash of URI's keyed by namespace prefix, used by XMP module
	during writing to remember all used namespaces</td></tr>
