ExifTool by Phil Harvey (phil at owl.phy.queensu.ca)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ExifTool is a highly customizable Perl script that extracts EXIF, GPS, IPTC,
XMP, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile and Photoshop IRB meta information from JPG, TIFF,
GIF, CRW, THM, CR2, MRW, NEF, PEF, ORF and DNG images.  ExifTool also
extracts information from the maker notes of many digital cameras by various
manufacturers including Canon, Casio, FujiFilm, Minolta/Konica-Minolta,
Nikon, Olympus/Epson, Panasonic/Leica, Pentax/Asahi, Sanyo and Sigma/Foveon.

ExifTool also writes meta information.  Currently, EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP and
MakerNotes information can be written to JPEG, TIFF, GIF, CRW, THM, CR2, NEF,
PEF and DNG files.  See html/index.html for more details about the ExifTool
features.

ExifTool can be downloaded from

   Main server URL:  http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
   Alternate URL:    http://130.15.24.87/~phil/exiftool/

Note:  Please do not make links to the alternate URL above, because this
server is not permanent.

RUNNING

The exiftool script can be run right away without the need to install
Image::ExifTool.  For example, from within the exiftool directory you can
extract the information from one of the included test files by typing:

   ./exiftool t/ExifTool.jpg

If you move the exiftool script to a different directory, you must also
either move the contents of the lib directory or install the Image::ExifTool
package so the script can find the necessary libraries.

INSTALLATION

You can install the Image::ExifTool package to make it available for use by
other Perl scripts by typing the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note: You need root access for the last step above.

DEPENDENCIES

No special libraries needed.
