ExifTool by Phil Harvey (phil@owl.phy.queensu.ca)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

ExifTool is a highly customizable Perl script that extracts meta
information from JPG, TIFF, CRW, THM and GIF images.  ExifTool can read
EXIF, IPTC, XMP and GeoTIFF formatted data as well as the maker notes of
many digital cameras from various manufacturers including Canon, Casio,
FujiFilm, Minolta, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, Sanyo and Sigma.

ExifTool can be downloaded from

   http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

RUNNING

The exiftool script can be run right away without the need to install
Image::ExifTool.  For example, if you change directory to the exiftool
directory, you can extract information from one of the included test
files by typing:

   ./exiftool t/ExifTool.jpg

You can move the exiftool script to wherever you like, however for the
script to work in the new location you must also move the accompanying
lib directory or install the Image::ExifTool package.

INSTALLATION

You can install the Image::ExifTool package to make it available for use
by other Perl scripts by typing the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
   
Note: You need root access for the last step above.

DEPENDENCIES

No special libraries needed.
