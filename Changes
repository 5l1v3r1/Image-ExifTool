ExifTool Version History

Note: The most recent production release is Version 5.67.

Oct. 13/05 - Version 5.67 (production release)

  - Fixed a problem when writing information via the ExifTool API if using Perl
    5.8 or later and passing a UTF-8 encoded string to SetNewValue().  The

    to the group1 name for subsequent profiles to make the tag locations unique
  - Changed Photoshop PixelsPerInchX/Y and QuickTime DotsPerInchX/Y tag names to
    X/YResolution.  Neither has a corresponding ResolutionUnit tag, so inches
    should be assumed if no resolution unit is present.

    rewriting TIFF images (avoids possible data loss if attempting to write an
    unsuported RAW image with a TIFF-like data structure)
  - Added ability to replace existing tags with user defined tags
  - Denote minor errors/warnings by adding '[minor]' to the message (these are
    the errors which can be ignored with the -m option)

    -GROUP:All and --TAG options are used together on the command line

May 5/05 - Version 5.10

  - ALL MAJOR PLANNED WRITING FEATURES NOW IMPLEMENTED!
  - Finally solved problem of writing large preview images in JPEG files

    notes to avoid writing a large preview to the destination file (now you have
    to do this manually afterwards if this is what you want)
  - Fixed problem rewriting Olympus E1 maker note subdirectories
  - Only validate extracted images when Binary (-b) option is used
  - Rename Olympus PreviewImageAvailable to PreviewImageValid, and check/set

    missing tags when the -f option is used
  - Account for different encoding of Canon ExposureTime in 20D and 350D, and

    maker notes)

Mar. 9/05 - Version 4.84

        a SCALAR reference, the same as with PrintConv values

Mar. 1/05 - Version 4.73 (production release)

  - Minor changes to XMP parsing to increase speed and improve validation

Feb. 28/05 - Version 4.72

    Perl 5.6.1 or greater anyway... Earlier versions don't have the required
    UTF-8 support to handle these special characters)
  - Improvements to TagNames documentation (including changing format names to

Feb. 14/05 - Version 4.61

  - Don't print filename line when -p option used
  - JPEG 2000 improvements

  - Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't

  - Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
  - Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed.
  - Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
  - Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)

  - Added check at higher level and return warning if trying to delete
    information from maker notes
  - Make GPS latitude and longitude a bit more flexible about the format they
    accept when writing
  - Updates to documentation

Jan. 19/05 - Version 4.32

  - Now rewrites Casio EX-Z3 maker notes properly (well, not actually
    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
  - Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
  - Fixed parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
  - No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.23

  - Improve handling of unrecognized maker notes when writing

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.22

    directory running outside the maker notes data. If they do, a warning is
    issued and the maker notes are rebuilt properly before copying.
  - Fixed problem which could corrupt some values when editing maker notes.

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.21

  - Added Olympus Red/BlueBalance

Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.20

  - Added more validation when writing IPTC information
  - Fixed display of Nikon FlashExposureComp for negative values

    This allows all 3 JPEG images contained in Pentax PEF files to be extracted:
    ThumbnailImage, PreviewImage and JpgFromRaw.
  - Fixed problem on systems that use backslashes in directory names that
    prevented exiftool from finding its libraries if not installed
  - Changed many Pentax tag names to remove "Pentax" prefix and conform more to
    the other tag names (moving information between files of different formats
    is much easier if tags have standardized names):

      - PentaxWhiteBalance => WhiteBalance
      - PentaxAEMetering => MeteringMode
      - PentaxFocalLength => FocalLength

    Canonism
  - Improved logic to recognize more types of unknown maker notes
