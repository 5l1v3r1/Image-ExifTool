    being properly removed from one IFD when written to the other
<li>Added FAQ
</ul>

<b>May 2/05 - Version 5.06</b>
<ul>

    the value data of an IFD entry (only effects Casio images)
<li>Fixed problems rewriting some Casio maker notes
<li>Change priority of orientation (and a number of other tags which may appear
    in IFD1) so value in IFD0 takes precedence of value in IFD1 if it exists
<li>API Changes:
    <ul>
    <li>Allow any file reference, not only GLOB references, to be used in
        function calls
    </ul>
</ul>

<b>Apr. 16/05 - Version 5.02</b>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>ALL MAJOR PLANNED WRITING FEATURES NOW IMPLEMENTED!
<li>Finally solved problem of writing large preview images in JPEG files
<li>-AllTagsFromFile now sets PreviewImage to 'dummy' if it exists in the maker
    notes to avoid writing a large preview to the destination file (now you have

    missing tags when the -f option is used
<li>Account for different encoding of Canon ExposureTime in 20D and 350D, and
    lower priority of Canon ExposureTime and FNumber so regular EXIF values take
    precedence because it appears these values may be model dependent (I hate it
    when that happens)
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added support for Kodak DX3215 and DX3700

<ul>
<li>Recognize JPEG 2000 XMP UUID information

<li>Yet more playing with XP characters (this has been a learning process for
    me). Now special characters show up properly in my OSX terminal window, and
    the reverse translation works so now they get written properly as well (for
    Perl 5.6.1 or greater anyway... Earlier versions don't have the required
    UTF8 support to handle these special characters)

<li>Decode JPEG 2000 Resolution, Label and URL information
<li>Another try at patching 3 digit exponent situation which causes failed tests
    on MSWin32-x86
<li>Removed .J2K from recognized extensions (since apparently this is a raw JP2
    codestream, and doesn't contain any metadata that ExifTool can extract)
</ul>

<li>Changed CanonRaw to bring code up to CIFF specification
<li>Added a bunch more CanonRaw tags
<li>Updated Canon CRW documentation
</ul>

<b>Feb. 2/05 - Version 4.50</b>
<ul>
<li>Allow writing to specific IFD
<li>Allow permanent tags (ie. MakerNotes tags) 'deleted' by setting them to an
    empty string if '' is a valid value for the tag

</ul>

<b>Jan. 30/05 - Version 4.44</b>

<li>Change validation of CanonPictureInfo to get it working for Canon 20D
</ul>

<b>Jan. 26/05 - Version 4.40</b>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to write Canon RAW (CRW) files.  With this format you aren't
    allowed to add or delete any new tags (just as with the MakerNotes), except
    for JpgFromRaw, which I like to be able to delete to save disk space.
<li>Added validation of JpgFromRaw images
<li>Relax filtering on non-ASCII characters by exiftool script to allow
    high-ASCII characters to be printed.
<li>Changed the tense of Orientation values to try to make the meaning more
    clear.  This tag can be a bit confusing. It gives the rotation that must be
    applied to the image to view it properly (hence the rotation of the camera
    when the picture was taken).
<li>Patched problem which was causing failed tests on some platforms (floating
    point format has 3 digits in exponent on Perl 5.8.5 MSWin32-x86, grrrr...)

<li>Added -o option to write to different file or directory
<li>Added handler to clean up temporary file on Ctrl-C
<li>Re-wrote routine to rationalize floating point values (it is slower now, but
    produces much prettier fractions)
<li>Other minor improvements to writer code
</ul>

<b>Jan. 19/05 - Version 4.33</b>
<ul>
<li>Added check at higher level and return warning if trying to delete
    information from maker notes

    accept when writing
<li>Updates to documentation
</ul>

<b>Jan. 19/05 - Version 4.32</b>
<ul>

    'properly', but the way they were written in the first place, which is
    wrong)
<li>Added warning when writing information if original IFD entries were not in
    the proper sequence, which is a violation of EXIF specs.  (And surprise,
    you'll never guess who does this too...  Yup, the EX-Z3.)
<li>Fixed parsing problem with GPSProcessingMethod and GPSAreaInformation
<li>No longer truncates 'undef' values at first null character
<li>Changed all DataDump tags to binary data types
<li>Changed some warning messages

    since version 4.10)
<li>Added some more writer tests
</ul>

<b>Jan. 18/05 - Version 4.31</b>
<ul>
<li>Now also copies over preview image in Nikon NEF files
</ul>

<b>Jan. 18/05 - Version 4.30</b>
<ul>
<li>Now copies over preview images in EXIF data (large, external previews still
    not copied).
<li>Account for funny offsets in Casio EX-Z3 maker notes while extracting data
    (but haven't figured out how to handle them when writing)
<li>Fixed bug introduced in 4.20 that broke extraction of Canon PreviewImage
</ul>

<b>Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.23</b>
<ul>
<li>Improve handling of unrecognized maker notes when writing
</ul>

<b>Jan. 17/05 - Version 4.22</b>
<ul>
<li>Added check in -AllTagsFromFile to test for pointers in the maker notes

    prevented exiftool from finding its libraries if not installed
